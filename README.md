# Easy ToDo: The Productivity App

> A simple and user-friendly to-do web application is here to help you organize and streamline your daily tasks and responsibilities.

## Features
With this web app, users can:

- Procrastinate in style by adding new to-do items.
- Avoid actually getting things done by endlessly editing and modifying existing to-do items.
- Pretend to be productive by marking to-do items as complete (just don't look too closely at that ever-growing list...)
- Enjoy the sweet release of deleting a to-do item and pretending it never existed in the first place. Ahh, the joys of procrastination. 😎
